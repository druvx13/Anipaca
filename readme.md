<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Anipaca Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacaHat/Anipaca/refs/heads/main/public/images/banner.png "Anipaca Screenshot")

**Anipaca** is an open-source PHP-based application designed to provide a high-quality anime streaming experience. It leverages external APIs to deliver a wide range of anime content, offering features tailored for anime enthusiasts. The platform is built with a focus on user experience, offering multiple resolution options and broad device compatibility.

Key original strengths include:
*   **Ad-Free Potential:** Designed to allow streaming without disruptive video ads (dependent on deployment choices).
*   **Multiple Resolutions:** Supports streaming in 1080p, 720p, 480p, and 360p.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Accessible on PCs, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, and smart TVs.
*   **User-Friendly Navigation:** Features for browsing by genre, season, and other criteria.

## Anipaca V2 - Key Improvements & Features

Anipaca V2 introduces significant updates, modernizing the codebase and enhancing functionality:

*   **PHP 8.x Modernization:**
    *   The entire codebase has been updated for compatibility with PHP 8.x (specifically targeting PHP 8.3).
    *   This includes adopting modern PHP syntax, robust error handling using exceptions (e.g., `mysqli_sql_exception`), and leveraging performance improvements inherent in newer PHP versions.
    *   Deprecated features and patterns from older PHP versions have been addressed or removed.

*   **M3U8 Download/Stream Link Feature:**
    *   Users can now access M3U8 playlist links directly on the watch page for each available stream (SUB/DUB).
    *   These links can be used with external media players like VLC or with third-party download managers and tools (e.g., JDownloader, `yt-dlp`) for offline viewing.
    *   Anipaca acts as a bridge to these M3U8 links from the API; it does not host or convert any media files itself.

*   **Code Refinements & Robustness:**
    *   Key areas of the application, including `details.php`, various AJAX handlers (e.g., comment system, watch history, watchlist updates), and user management scripts (`login.php`, `register.php`, `profile.php`, `logout.php`), have undergone significant refinement.
    *   Improvements focus on enhanced error handling (both server-side and for AJAX responses), consistent HTML escaping to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, input sanitization, and overall code clarity for better maintainability.
    *   Production-friendly error reporting settings have been integrated into `_config.php` to suppress direct error output and enable logging.

*   **Watchlist Functionality Note:**
    *   The watchlist update mechanism (`src/ajax/wl-up.php`) has had its error handling logic drafted and tested. However, due to persistent issues with the automated deployment tools for this specific file, its final refined version is pending manual code application during the V2 deployment. The core functionality remains operational.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To set up Anipaca on your own server (e.g., cPanel hosting), follow these steps:

### API Setup

Anipaca relies on external APIs. You will need to deploy or have access to instances of the following:

| API Name     | Deploy Link (Example)                                                                                              | Notes                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Main API     | [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/PacaHat/zen-api)          | Provides core anime data, search, etc.    |
| M3U8 Proxy   | [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/PacaHat/shrina-proxy) | Proxies M3U8 stream links if needed.      |

Update the API endpoints in your `_config.php` file accordingly.

### Installation

1.  **Clone or Download:**
    Obtain the Anipaca V2 source code:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PacaHat/Anipaca.git
    cd Anipaca
    ```
    Alternatively, download the ZIP archive from the repository.

2.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Import the `database.sql` file (located in the root directory) into your MySQL database. This will create the necessary tables.
    *   Update your database connection details (hostname, username, password, database name) in the `_config.php` file.

3.  **Configuration (`_config.php`):**
    Ensure your `_config.php` file is correctly set up. Below is an example structure:
    ```php
    <?php
    // Production Error Reporting
    ini_set('display_errors', '0');
    ini_set('log_errors', '1');
    error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT);
    
    mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);

    try {
        $conn = new mysqli("YOUR_HOSTNAME", "YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_PASSWORD", "YOUR_DATABASE");
    } catch (mysqli_sql_exception $e) {
        error_log("Database connection failed: " . $e->getMessage());
        die("Database connection failed. Please try again later or contact support.");
    }

    $websiteTitle = "Anipaca"; // Your Website Title
    $protocol = (!empty($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] !== 'off') ? "https" : "http";
    $websiteUrl = "{$protocol}://{$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']}"; // Your website URL
    $websiteLogo = $websiteUrl . "/public/logo/logo.png";
    $contactEmail = "your_email@example.com";

    $version = "2.0.0"; // Anipaca Version

    // Social Links (Optional)
    $discord = "https://discord.gg/your_server";
    $github = "https://github.com/your_profile";
    // ... other links

    // API Endpoints
    $zpi = "https://your-main-api-deployment.com/api"; // Main API (zen-api)
    $proxy = $websiteUrl . "/src/ajax/proxy.php?url="; // Proxy for M3U8 links (if using local proxy)
    // Alternative: $proxy = "https://your-m3u8proxy-deployment.com/proxy?url=";

    $banner = $websiteUrl . "/public/images/banner.png"; // Default banner
    ?>
    ```

4.  **File Permissions:**
    Ensure that directories like `cache/` (if used for search or other caching) are writable by the web server.

5.  **Web Server Configuration:**
    *   A `.htaccess` file is included for Apache web servers to enable user-friendly URLs. Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled.
    *   For Nginx, you will need to configure URL rewriting manually. Example (basic):
        ```nginx
        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }
        ```
